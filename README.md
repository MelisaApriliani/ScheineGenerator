# ScheineGenerator
A system for doctors to generate various types of "Scheine" (e.g., AU, Ãœberweisung, Rezepte) used in German medical practices. It includes a backend for form data processing and PDF generation, and a frontend for doctors to input information, preview, and generate the final "Schein."
